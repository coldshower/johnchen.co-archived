        <p>Mpowered Entrepreneurship</p>
        <p>helps student entrepreneurs through the hosting of events like MHacks, America's biggest hackathon, and 
            1000 pitches, America's largest pitching contest. Through these events, motivated students can find support 
            and resources to help them along their path. 
        </p>
        <p>During my time in college, I both helped create and participated in
            these events.

        <p>Startup Weekend</p>
        <p>A Google powered national event that combines hack and hustle. In 54 hours, students form teams and create a startup from
            nothing, pitching their work to judges and mentors who can bring your startup even further. At this event I co-founded
            Edyou, an educational software startup. 
        </p>
        <p>Did not win, and the team did not stay together, but I was featured in this MPowered promotional video (00:13)

        <p>Take 36 Filmathon</p>
        <p>The first student film competition in Ann Arbor. I helped to market and plan this weekend-long event, and even taught a class
            on video editing with After Effects.</p>
        <p>Watch the films here: <a href="https://goo.gl/KxC9Tf" target="_blank">First Take 36 Films</a> (It's not Sundance yet, but 
            we'll get there one day)</p>

        <p>Startup Academy</p>
        <p>A course on how to go from zero to launch for your startup. Courses included guest speakers who taught customer discovery,
            pitching, and marketing.</p>
        <p>
            I made their website which can be seen here:
