		<p>Goals for the Website, and any website for that matter</p>
		<p>
			My <strong>first priority</strong> was to <i>communicate effectively</i>.
			Aesthetics and technology are great, but meaningless when put next to 
			<a href="http://www.inc.com/magazine/20100501/why-is-business-writing-so-awful.html" target="_blank">unengaging text</a>.
			Too many companies treat text as simply an SEO or buzzword sink and what ends up happenning is text
			with barely more meaning than Lorem Ipsum.

						When someone tells you <i>no</i>, there is a reason for it, whether it be 
						a fear or concern. If you can assuage that feeling, then that person has no choice but to say yes. 
						When potential clients say "no" or "I have to think about it," what are they actually saying in their heads? Probably concerns
						about the costs, timeframe, or the actual value of what they are buying. Through a Hello and Q&A section, I try
						to address any possible question they have. 
					</li>
					<li>
						<i>Questionnaires</i>. By letting potential clients fill out questionnaires, we can filter out clients that have no idea
						what they want and will probably not be worth the lifelong aftermath of migraines. On the other hand, we will get clients that 
						we love working for and thus can make amazing products for.
